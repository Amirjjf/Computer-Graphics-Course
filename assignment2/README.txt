# First, some questions about where you come from and how you got started.
# Your answers in this section will be used to improve the course.
# They will not be judged or affect your points, but please answer all of them.
# Keep it short; answering shouldn't take you more than 5-10 minutes.

- What are you studying here at Aalto? (Department, major, minor...?) Computer Science

- Which year of your studies is this? First

- Is this a mandatory course for you? No

- Have you had something to do with graphics before? Other studies, personal interests, work?
Nothing

- Do you remember basic linear algebra? Matrix and vector multiplication, cross product, that sort of thing?
Little

- How is your overall programming experience? What language are you most comfortable with?
Javascript and typescript are my favs, I am good at them and also good at python

- Do you have some experience with these things? Which versions of them? (If not, do you have experience with something similar such as C or Direct3D?)
C++:not really, just a little
OpenGL: no experience
I knew C but not much

- Have you used a version control system such as Git, Mercurial or Subversion? Which ones?
yes, git

- Did you work on the assignment using Aalto computers, your own computers, or both? my own



# Which parts of the assignment did you complete? Mark them 'done'.
# You can also mark non-completed parts as 'attempted' if you spent a fair amount of
# effort on them. If you do, explain the work you did in the problems/bugs section
# and leave your 'attempt' code in place (commented out if necessary) so we can see it.


R1, R2, R3, R4, R5 done 
extra features recommended, easy, medium all of them are done completely
hard features are done completely except for the last feature (Terrain rendering on GPU (6 p)) which was attempted.
very hard features not done



# Known issues

no issues 


# Are there any known problems/bugs remaining in your code?

No


# Did you collaborate with anyone in the class? no

(Did you help others? Did others help you? Let us know who you talked to, and what sort of help you gave or received.)
no

# Did you use any AI tools to complete the assignment? yes, AI helped me in the extra credits especially the hard questions and medium ones.

(What did you use and how? We're interested in your experiences to get an idea of how to best accommodate for the future.)

# Any other comments you'd like to share about the assignment or the course so far?

(Was the assignment too long? Too hard? Fun or boring? Did you learn something, or was it a total waste of time? Can we do something differently to help you learn? Please be brutally honest; we won't take it personally.)


Just cuz you said be honest... 

the assignments are absolutely difficult. it seems like that the assignments are created for c++ developers with min 10 years of coding experience. even with getting help and suggestions from AI tools it took 30 hours to write and I still couldn't get to the very hard problems. if you just rely on yourself to code, in my opinion it will take more than 120 hours to be able to go through all the questions (or I guess I'm too dumb which I don't think so). without AI tools it is "ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE" to be able to solve some of the extra credit questions, unless you have many years of experience on your own. the issue with difficult questions is that you literally don't learn anything from them because they are WAY out of your league. I really liked the first week where we created the cone and mesh because I actually learned them well. I'm here to learn computer graphics from scratch but apparently it doesn't seem like it cuz the course is designed for Alan Turing or sth XD
